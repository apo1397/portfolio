## About Me

I'm Apoorv Abhishek, a Product Manager with a background in backend development. My experience encompasses diverse industries, from the intricacies of B2B SaaS solutions to the fast-paced dynamics of e-commerce marketplaces and the unique challenges of real estate platforms. I thrive on creating innovative products that solve real-world problems and improve user experiences. In my spare time (what little there is!), I've recently become a restaurateur, adding another dimension to my ever-evolving journey. I believe in embracing change, learning constantly, and always striving for the "new vibe code."
